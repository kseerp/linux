description: |
  The AD3530R/AD3530 are low power, 8-channel, 16-bit, buffered voltage output,
  DACs that include a 2.5 V internal reference (disabled by default), and a
  gain bit field, resulting in a full-scale output span of 2.5 V (gain
  = 1) or 5 V (gain = 2) for a reference voltage of 2.5 V.

  ref-supply:
    description:
      Reference Input/Output. The voltage at the REF pin sets the full-scale
      range of all channels. If not provided the internal reference is used and
      also provided on the VREF pin.

  reset-gpios:
    description:
      Active low signal that is falling edge sensitive. When it is deasserted,
      the digital core initialization is performed and all DAC registers except
      the Interface Configuration A register are reset to their default values.
    maxItems: 1

  ldac-gpios:
    description:
      LDAC pin to be used as a hardware trigger to update the DAC channels. If
      not present, the DAC channels are updated by Software LDAC.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,double-output-range:
    description:
      Configure the output range for all channels. If the property is present,
      the output will range from 0V to 2Vref. If the property is not
      present, the output will range from 0V to Vref.
